    steps:
      # 1. First, check out your repository's code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Then, set up your Java/JDK environment
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'

      # 3. Now, other steps that need your code can run
      # For example, a step to build your Gradle project
      - name: Build with Gradle
        run: ./gradlew build

      # Or a dependency submission step that was likely causing the error
      - name: Submit Dependency Graph
        uses: actions/dependency-submission-action@v3
